\title{Kernel function.}
\usage{
kernel(spec, theta, y, log = TRUE)
kernel(fit, log = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{spec}{Model specification of class \code{MSGARCH_SPEC} created with \code{\link{create.spec}}.}

\item{theta}{Vector (of size d) or matrix (of size M x d) of parameter estimates.}

\item{y}{Vector (of size T) of observations.}

\item{log}{Boolean indicating if the log kernel is returned. (Default: \code{log = TRUE})}

\item{fit}{Fit object of type \code{MSGARCH_MLE_FIT} created with \code{\link{fit.mle}} or \code{MSGARCH_BAY_FIT} created with \code{\link{fit.bayes}}.}
}
\value{
(Log-)Kernel value (scalar or vector of size M) of the vector of observations.
}
\description{
Method returning the kernel value of a vector of observations given a model specification.
}
\details{
If a matrix of parameter estimates is given, each parameter estimates is evaluated individually.
 The kernel is a combination of the prior and the likelihood function. 
 The kernel is equal to prior(\eqn{\theta}) + L(y|\eqn{\theta}) where L is the likelihood
 of y given the parameter \eqn{\theta}. When doing optimization, the goal is to minimize the negative log-kernel.
 \itemize{
 \item Details on the prior \cr
       The prior is different for each specification. It ensures that the \eqn{\theta} makes the conditional variance process stationary, positive,
       and that it respect that the sums of the probabilities in the case of a multiple-regime models are all equal to 1. If any of these three conditions is not respected the prior return \code{-1e10}, meaning that the optimizer or sampler
       will know that \eqn{\theta} is not a good candidate.
